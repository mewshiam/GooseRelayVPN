**[🇮🇷 راهنمای فارسی (Persian)](README_FA.md)**

A SOCKS5 VPN that tunnels **raw TCP** through a Google Apps Script web app to your own small VPS exit server. To anything on the network path your client only ever talks TLS to a Google IP with `SNI=www.google.com`. Everything in flight is AES-256-GCM encrypted end-to-end — Google never sees plaintext and never holds the key.

> **How it works in simple terms:** Your browser/app talks SOCKS5 to this tool on your computer. The tool wraps every TCP byte in AES-GCM frames and posts them through a Google-facing HTTPS connection to a free Apps Script web app you control. The Apps Script forwards those bytes verbatim to your own VPS, which decrypts and opens the real connection. To the firewall/filter it looks like you're just talking to Google.

> ⚠️ **You need a small VPS for the exit server.** Unlike pure-Apps-Script proxies, this project tunnels raw TCP — anything SOCKS5 can carry — so a real `net.Dial` has to happen somewhere. A $4/month DigitalOcean droplet is plenty. In exchange you can tunnel SSH, IMAP, custom protocols, anything — not just HTTP.

## How It Works

```
Browser/App
  -> SOCKS5  (127.0.0.1:1080)
  -> AES-256-GCM raw-TCP frames
  -> HTTPS to a Google edge IP   (SNI=www.google.com, Host=script.google.com)
  -> Apps Script doPost()        (dumb forwarder, never sees plaintext)
  -> Your VPS :8443/tunnel       (decrypts, demuxes by session_id, dials target)
  <- Same path in reverse via long-polling
```

Your application sends TCP bytes through the SOCKS5 listener on your computer. The client encrypts each chunk with AES-256-GCM and POSTs batches over a domain-fronted HTTPS connection to your Apps Script web app. The Apps Script is a ~30-line script that forwards the body verbatim to your VPS — it never decrypts and the AES key never touches Google. Your VPS decrypts, dials the real target, and pumps bytes back along the same path. The filter sees only TLS to Google.

---

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Step 1: Get a VPS for the exit server

You need a small Linux VPS that Apps Script's `UrlFetchApp` can reach on TCP/8443. Any provider works; ~$4/month at DigitalOcean is plenty.

- Create an Ubuntu droplet, note its public IP.
- Open inbound TCP/8443 in the droplet's firewall.
- Confirm you can `ssh user@droplet-ip` and that the user has `sudo`.

### Step 2: Clone and build

Requires Go 1.22+ on your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kianmhz/relay-tunnel.git
cd relay-tunnel
go build -o relay-client ./cmd/client
go build -o relay-server ./cmd/server
```

### Step 3: Generate an AES-256 key

```bash
bash scripts/gen-key.sh
```

Copy the 64-character hex string. You'll paste the **same value** into both config files in the next step. This is the only authentication between client and server — protect it.

### Step 4: Configure

Copy the example configs:

```bash
cp client_config.example.json client_config.json
cp server_config.example.json   server_config.json
```

Open both and paste the AES hex string into `aes_key_hex` in **both files**. Leave `script_url` blank for now — you'll fill it in after Step 5.

`client_config.json`:

```json
{
  "listen_addr": "127.0.0.1:1080",
  "google_ip":   "216.239.38.120:443",
  "sni_host":    "www.google.com",
  "script_url":  "PASTE_AFTER_STEP_5",
  "aes_key_hex": "PASTE_OUTPUT_OF_GEN_KEY"
}
```

`server_config.json`:

```json
{
  "listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:8443",
  "aes_key_hex": "SAME_VALUE_AS_CLIENT"
}
```

### Step 5: Deploy the Apps Script forwarder

This is the dumb pipe that disguises your traffic as Google.

1. Open [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) and sign in.
2. Click **New project**.
3. Delete the default code.
4. Open [`apps_script/Code.gs`](apps_script/Code.gs) from this repo, copy everything, paste into the editor.
5. Change this line to your droplet's IP:
   ```javascript
   const DO_URL = 'http://YOUR.DROPLET.IP:8443/tunnel';
   ```
6. Click **Deploy → New deployment** (gear icon → **Web app**).
7. Set:
   - **Execute as:** Me
   - **Who has access:** Anyone
8. Click **Deploy** and copy the `/exec` URL.
9. Paste that URL into `script_url` in `client_config.json`.

> ⚠️ **Editing the script doesn't update the live version.** Every time you change `Code.gs` you must create a **new deployment** and update `script_url` in your client config.

Verify the deployment:

```bash
curl "$YOUR_SCRIPT_URL"
# should print: relay-tunnel forwarder OK
```

### Step 6: Deploy the exit server

A helper script builds a Linux binary, ships it to your droplet, and installs a systemd unit:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy.sh user@your.droplet.ip
```

Verify it's live:

```bash
curl http://your.droplet.ip:8443/healthz   # HTTP 200, empty body
```

### Step 7: Run the client locally

```bash
./relay-client -config client_config.json
```

You should see:

```
[client] SOCKS5 listening on 127.0.0.1:1080
```

### Step 8: Use it

Smoke test:

```bash
curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080 https://api.ipify.org
```

This should print your **droplet's** IP, not your home IP.

Configure your browser/system to use SOCKS5 `127.0.0.1:1080`. **Use `socks5h://`** (not `socks5://`) so DNS travels through the tunnel — otherwise hostnames get resolved on your local network and the proxy never sees them.

- **Firefox:** Settings → Network Settings → Manual proxy → SOCKS5 host `127.0.0.1` port `1080`. Check **Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5**.
- **Chrome/Edge:** Use a proxy-switching extension (FoxyProxy, SwitchyOmega). Native OS proxy settings don't speak SOCKS5 with remote DNS cleanly.
- **System-wide on macOS/Linux:** SOCKS5 proxy in network settings.

## LAN Sharing (Optional)

By default the client listens on `127.0.0.1:1080` so only your computer can use it. To share with other devices on your local network, change `listen_addr` in `client_config.json` to `0.0.0.0:1080` and restart.

> ⚠️ **Security note:** Anyone on your LAN can then proxy through your tunnel and consume your Apps Script quota. Only do this on trusted networks.

---

## Configuration

### Client (`client_config.json`)

| Field | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `listen_addr` | `127.0.0.1:1080` | Where the local SOCKS5 listener binds. Change to `0.0.0.0:1080` for LAN sharing. |
| `google_ip` | `216.239.38.120:443` | Google edge IP to dial. Any 216.239.x.120 served by Google works. |
| `sni_host` | `www.google.com` | SNI presented during TLS handshake. The decoy an on-path observer sees. |
| `script_url` | — | Your Apps Script `/exec` URL from Step 5. |
| `aes_key_hex` | — | 64-char hex AES-256 key. Must match the server byte-for-byte. |

### Server (`server_config.json`)

| Field | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `listen_addr` | `0.0.0.0:8443` | Where the exit server's HTTP handler binds. Must be reachable from Google's network. |
| `aes_key_hex` | — | 64-char hex AES-256 key. Must match the client. |

## Updating the Apps Script forwarder

If you change `Code.gs` — for example to point at a new droplet IP — you must create a **new deployment** in the Apps Script editor (Deploy → **New deployment**, not just "Manage deployments"). Saving alone does nothing; the live `/exec` URL serves the published version. After redeploying, update `script_url` in `client_config.json`.

## Architecture

```
┌─────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌──────────┐
│ Browser │──►│ relay-client │──►│ Google edge  │──►│ Apps Script │──►│  Your    │──► Internet
│  / App  │◄──│  (SOCKS5)    │◄──│ TLS, fronted │◄──│  doPost()   │◄──│  VPS     │◄──
└─────────┘   └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └──────────┘
              AES-256-GCM         SNI=www.google     dumb forwarder    decrypt +
              session multiplex   Host=script.…      no plaintext      net.Dial
```

Key invariants:

- **Authentication = AES-GCM tag.** No shared password, no certificates. Frames that fail `Open()` are dropped silently.
- **Apps Script never sees plaintext.** The script is a ~30-line forwarder; the AES key lives only on your machine and the VPS.
- **DNS travels through the tunnel.** The SOCKS5 server uses a no-op resolver; use `socks5h://` so DNS is resolved at the exit, not locally.
- **Long-poll, full-duplex.** The VPS holds each request open for 8s waiting for downstream bytes; the client reposts as soon as it returns. Two HTTP exchanges in flight at once give a full-duplex pipe.

### Wire format

- **Frame** (plaintext, before AES-GCM): `session_id (16) || seq (u64 BE) || flags (u8) || target_len (u8) || target || payload_len (u32 BE) || payload`
- **Envelope** (AES-GCM): `nonce (12) || ciphertext+tag`. Per-frame nonce, empty AAD.
- **HTTP body**: `[u16 frame_count] [u32 frame_len][envelope] ...`, then base64-encoded so it survives Apps Script's `ContentService` text round-trip.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| `decode batch: illegal base64 data at input byte 0` | Apps Script returned an HTML page instead of an encrypted batch. Either `script_url` doesn't point at a live deployment, or **Who has access** isn't set to `Anyone`. Re-deploy (Deploy → **New deployment**) and copy the new `/exec` URL into `client_config.json`. |
| `[carrier] non-OK status: 404` | Same root cause as above — the `/exec` URL isn't live. Re-deploy. |
| `[carrier] non-OK status: 500` | Apps Script can't reach `DO_URL`. Check the IP in `Code.gs`, confirm the VPS is up, and confirm inbound TCP/8443 is open. `curl http://your.vps.ip:8443/healthz` should return 200. |
| `[carrier] post: ... timeout` | Fronted connection to Google is failing. Try a different `google_ip` — any 216.239.x.120 served by Google works. |
| Browser hangs on every request | You're using `socks5://` instead of `socks5h://`. The non-`h` form resolves DNS locally and the proxy gets called with raw IPs. |
| `[exit] dial X: ... timeout` on the server | The target host blocks datacenter IPs, or your VPS has no outbound connectivity for that port. |
| Cloudflare-protected sites show captchas | Expected. Your VPS's IP is on a datacenter ASN (DigitalOcean = AS14061), which Cloudflare's bot scoring flags. Not a tunnel bug. |
| YouTube buffers a lot at 1080p | Expected. The tunnel adds ~300-800ms per round trip due to Apps Script dispatch overhead. 480p is comfortable. |
| Apps Script quota exhausted | Each free Google account gets ~20,000 `UrlFetchApp` calls per 24h. Heavy usage hits this. Wait until quota resets at midnight Pacific time (10:30 AM Iran time) or deploy under a second account. |
| Mismatched AES keys | Symptom: client logs no errors but no traffic flows; VPS logs `dial ...` lines never appear. Confirm `aes_key_hex` is byte-identical in both configs. |

## Security Tips

- **Never share `client_config.json` or `server_config.json`** — the AES key is in there and a leaked key means anyone can tunnel through your VPS.
- **Generate a fresh key with `scripts/gen-key.sh`** for every deployment. Don't reuse keys across hosts.
- **AES-GCM is the only authentication.** There's no password, no rate-limiting, no per-user accounting. Treat the key like a server-admin password.
- **Apps Script logs every `doPost` invocation** in Google's dashboard (count and duration only — Apps Script never sees plaintext).
- **Keep `listen_addr` on the client at `127.0.0.1`** unless you specifically want LAN sharing.
- **Each Apps Script deployment is rate-limited to ~20,000 calls/day** on free Google accounts.
